# parallelGO <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>

The goal of parallelGO is to provide parallel implementation (using foreach) for
exraction for gene ontology enrichment results given labeled sets of genes. The
project was inspired by the need to perform such analyses to evaluate gene 
networks. We had a lot of clusters and for each cluster we wanted a faster 
approach to obtain gene ontology enrichment results. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of parallelGO from 
[github](https://github.com) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("vitalinakomashko/parallelGO")
```
