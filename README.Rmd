# parallelGO <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>

The goal of `parallelGO` is to provide parallel implementation (using [foreach](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreach/) package) 
for gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis given labeled sets of genes. The
project was inspired by the need to do a fast evaluation of biological 
significance of identified clusters (also known as modules or sets) within gene 
networks.


## Installation

You can install the released version of parallelGO from 
[github](https://github.com) with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("vitalinakomashko/parallelGO")
```

This package requires two Bioconductor packages: [AnnotationDbi](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnnotationDbi.html) and [GOstats](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOstats.html).
If you don't have these packages installed you can either install them by
following instructions on the pages for these packages or, prior to installation
of parallelGO from github, run this line in R:

``` r
setRepositories(ind = 1:3)
```

This will set the repositories to CRAN, BioC software and BioC annotation. This
idea was found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20479243/1655368).

## How to use

If you have a file with human gene symbols where each symbol is assigned to a
gene set you can run the analysis by invoking the following code:

``` r
library(parallelGO)
out <- wrap_and_go("path_to_my_file", col_names = TRUE, delim = ",", 
                   id = "symbol", species = "human")
```
Mouse species and ensembl identifiers are also supported.

**IMPORTANT** Please prepare your file so that gene identifiers are in the first 
column and set labels are in the second column.

`wrap_and_go` will read the file, perform some minor cleaning, map 
identifiers to ENTREZ gene identifiers and run GO enrichment analysis in
parallel. Please read documentation for `wrap_and_go` to learn about additional
parameters.

If you don't have a file, but rather a data frame (`dat`) in memory, you can 
perform your analyses step by step in the same manner as it as performed by 
`wrap_and_go`:

``` r
# remove duplicated rows if present:
dat_clean <- deduplicate_rows(dat)
# map to ENTREZ gene identifiers:
dat_mapped <- map_genes(dat_clean, id = "symbol", species = "human")
# extract the universe for hypergeometric test:
universe <- unique(dat_mapped$entrez)
# remove sets with a small number of genes, OPTIONAL:
dat_large_sets <- remove_small_sets(dat_mapped, min_set_size = 30)
# run GO analysis in parallel
res <- run_parallel_go(dat_large_sets, species = "human", universe = universe)
```

In addition, we provide a function for filtering p-values (raw or adjusted)
which can be called after either scenario described above:

```r
res_filtered <- filter_pvalues(res, cutoff = 0.05)
```


## Example dataset

The package also provides a small example dataset for illustration purposes

```{r}
data("human_symbol")
head(human_symbol)
str(human_symbol)
```
